        <h1>What is HackFromHome?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Due to the COVID-19, most of us are confined at home wondering how to spend time at home, while trying to not lose the fight against boredom. For this reason, Hackers@UPC has raised an awesome initiative: an online hackathon! This way, hackathon lovers can spend their time at home doing what they love the most.</p>

          <p>
            If you love hackathons and want to spend an awesome day, this is for you. No need to be a student or have previous knowledge! We encourage you to make great projects! Either related to COVID-19 or not... your imagination is your limit.
